      <description>&lt;p&gt;In order to make the launch of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://globalgiftguide.org&quot; title=&quot;Visit the Global Gift Guide&quot;&gt;Global Gift Guide&lt;/a&gt; successful, we created this eCard app to delight our donors. It was a great tool for last-minute shoppers who wanted to give a meaningful gift. For this project, I was responsible for the art direction and UX. I coded the custom eCard templates with MailChimp allowing the donor to customize their message and when it was delivered. The app was built using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mandrill.com/&quot;&gt;Mandrill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mailchimp.com/&quot;&gt;MailChimp&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; transactional email service.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new shiny website is nice, but it means nothing if it doesn’t get people engaged. So, to accompany the launch of World Concern’s website, I thought it was important to create a handsome splash site that told a great story. By reading the story of &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldconcern.org/donate/campaigns/chad/&quot; title=&quot;Check out Achta and Yaya’s Story&quot;&gt;Achta and Yaya’s&lt;/a&gt; family, visitors easily see 6 different ways they can make an impact. The call to action at the bottom of the page encourages visitors to explore the website further. This splash site helped generate more traffic to the website and created buzz on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Intestinal worms suck the life out of you. &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldconcern.org/44centcure&quot; title=&quot;Visit the 44-Cent Cure&quot;&gt;The 44-Cent Cure&lt;/a&gt; is World Concern’s campaign eradicate these worms from millions of bellies. This campaign is a popular one, and most first time donors donate to this cause. Acquiring, keeping, and sustaining new donors is the lifeblood of any nonprofit, so I worked to make the 44-Cent Cure into an integrated campaign. We used AdRoll, AdWords, and Facebook Ads in order to spread the word. This strategy worked. The 44-Cent Cure is a steady stream of revenue for World Concern.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every Holiday season, World Concern rolls out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalgiftguide.org&quot; title=&quot;Visit the Global Gift Guide&quot;&gt;Global Gift Guide&lt;/a&gt;. I designed the first version in 2009, and I redesigned it in 2015. I adapted the look and feel from the print version to the website to keep it unified. Since the guide was designed to be responsive and easy to use, it generated 20% more revenue than the year before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as a part of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalgiftguide.org/givingtuesday&quot; title=&quot;View the Campaign&quot;&gt;Giving Tuesday campaign&lt;/a&gt;, I created a character named Totes Ma Goates, a charming goat that encouraged generous giving. We rolled out a whole marketing campaign: he had a jingle, Facebook ads, Tweets, and an email series. Because of this hair-brained idea, Giving Tuesday raised $54,000.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2013 I led the redesign of &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldconcern.org/&quot; title=&quot;Visit the Site&quot;&gt;World Concern&amp;rsquo;s website&lt;/a&gt; with an amazing team. We transformed the previously static website into a beautifully responsive experience, solidifying World Concern’s reputation as a trustworthy nonprofit.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe in the power of story-telling through photography, so I made it a priority to showcase World Concern’s rich imagery. By telling the stories of beneficiaries and their changed lives, the redesign increased fundraising dramatically. Since the redesign, I’ve been responsible for maintaining and upgrading the website with each new fundraising campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

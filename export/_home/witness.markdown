description: A new shiny website is nice, but it means nothing if it doesn’t get people
  engaged. So, to accompany the launch of World Concern’s website, I thought it was
  important to create a handsome splash site that told a great story. By reading the
  story of <a href="http://worldconcern.org/donate/campaigns/chad/" title="Check out
  Achta and Yaya’s Story">Achta and Yaya’s</a> family, visitors easily see 6 different
  ways they can make an impact. The call to action at the bottom of the page encourages
  visitors to explore the website further. This splash site helped generate more traffic
  to the website and created buzz on social media.

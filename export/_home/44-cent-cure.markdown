  title="Visit the 44-Cent Cure">The 44-Cent Cure</a> is World Concernâ€™s campaign
  eradicate these worms from millions of bellies. This campaign is a popular one,
  and most first time donors donate to this cause. Acquiring, keeping, and sustaining
  new donors is the life blood of any non profit, so I worked to make the 44-Cent
  Cure into an integrated campaign. We used AdRoll, AdWords, and Facebook Ads in order
  to spread the word. This strategy worked. The 44-Cent Cure is a steady stream of
  revenue for World Concern.

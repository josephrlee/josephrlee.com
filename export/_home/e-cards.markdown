description: In order to make the launch of the  <a href="http://globalgiftguide.org"
  title="Visit the Global Gift Guide">Global Gift Guide</a> successful, we created
  this eCard app to delight our donors. It was a great tool for last minute shoppers
  who wanted to give a meaningful gift.  For this project, I was responsible for the
  art direction and UX. I coded the custom eCard templates with MailChimp allowing
  the donor to customize their message and when it was delivered. The app was built
  using <a href="https://www.mandrill.com/">Mandrill</a>, <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp's</a>
  transactional email service.

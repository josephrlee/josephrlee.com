description: "Every Holiday season, World Concern rolls out the <a href=\"https://globalgiftguide.worldconcern.org\"
  title=\"Visit the Global Gift Guide\">Global Gift Guide</a>. I designed the first
  version in 2009, and I redesigned it in 2015. I adapted the look and feel  from
  the print version to the website to keep it unified. Since the guide was designed
  to be responsive and easy to use, it generated 20% more revenue than the year before.
  \n<br/><br/>\nAlso, as a part of our <a href=\"http://globalgiftguide.worldconcern.org/givingtuesday\"
  title=\"View the Campaign\">Giving Tuesday campaign</a>, I created a character named
  Totes Ma Goates, a charming goat that encouraged generous giving. We rolled out
  a whole marketing campaign: he had a jingle, Facebook ads, Tweets, and an email
  series. Because of this hair-brained idea, Giving Tuesday raised $54,000."

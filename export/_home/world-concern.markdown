description: "In 2013 I led the redesign of <a href=\"http://worldconcern.org/\" title=\"Visit
  the Site\">World Concern's website</a> with an amazing team. We transformed the
  previously static website into a beautifully responsive experience, solidifying
  World Concern’s reputation as a trustworthy nonprofit. \n<br/><br/>\nI believe in
  the power of story-telling through photography, so I made it a priority to showcase
  World Concern’s rich imagery. By telling the stories of beneficiaries and their
  changed lives, the redesign increased fundraising dramatically. Since the redesign,
  I’ve been responsible for maintaining and upgrading the website with each new fundraising
  campaign."

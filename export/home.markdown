Hi, I’m a designer living in Seattle. 

I am passionate about strategic and beautiful systems. 

I have 8 years of experience creating thoughtful and engaging user-friendly web experiences for both private and public companies. I use deliberate, functional, and elegant design to help organizations reach their goals. 

Currently, I am a Senior Designer at [World Concern](http://worldconcern.org), an international relief and development agency where I am responsible for all of World Concern’s digital efforts. 

If you’d like to get in touch, feel free to send me an [email](mailto:josephrlee.com).
